# Chatting-Application

This project focuses on the development of a real-time chatting application leveraging Java Swing for the graphical user interface and Java socket programming for network communication. The primary objective is to facilitate seamless text-based communication between users over a local network or the internet, simulating the core functionality of modern messaging platforms.


The application architecture employs a client-server model, where the server handles multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading. Each client connects to the server via TCP sockets, ensuring reliable and consistent message delivery. Key features include real-time message exchange, a user-friendly interface for composing and viewing messages, and efficient thread management to support concurrent conversations without performance degradation.


Built using the NetBeans IDE, the system emphasizes simplicity, responsiveness, and ease of use. It provides an accessible entry point into the world of network programming while showcasing the practical use of Java technologies for developing interactive desktop applications.


This chat system demonstrates the power of Java in building real-world communication tools and serves as a foundational step toward more advanced applications such as encrypted messaging, file transfer, or group chat functionalities. The project bridges the gap between core networking concepts and their practical applications, making it valuable for students, hobbyists, and professionals exploring distributed systems and GUI development.
